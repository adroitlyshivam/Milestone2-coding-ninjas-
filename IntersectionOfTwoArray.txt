 ##Intersection of Two Arrays II
 
/*You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2)
    of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their
    intersection; An intersection for this problem can be 
    defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value
    or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that
    exists in both the arrays/lists.
